# random_token
So I've often needed a robust token generator, so I thought this would be a good project to test coverage.py as it is only 50 lines of code and has some actual utility (you can use /dev/random which is blocking, or /dev/urandom which isn't blocking) any combination of letters, digits, upper and lower case. However in the default __init__ call, self.__lowercase is set to true which results in upper case letters being omitted from the character set due to a single missing character (the + append operator). I found that while writing test cases is definitely a good exercise for lower level components, there seems to be a logarithmically increasing amount of effort to get test coverage to 100% using coverage.py. But there's still obviously more tests needed. So I'm saying we can waste a lot of effort if we're not careful.
